# Glossary

Reinforcement learning can be a hefty topic, especially for those with little to no experience in machine learning. Throughout my learning process, I've found that understanding a single concept often requires adventuring down a deep rabbithole of related terminology, statistical concepts, and random Youtube videos in a spite-fueled journey at 2am. I hope that by providing a glossary of useful definitions and resources, I can make that learning process a little bit easier, so every time you have to Google (or ChatGPT) a concept, you know exactly where to look and what to look for.
